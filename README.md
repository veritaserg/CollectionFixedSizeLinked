Objectives

This is a simple implementation of a collection with a fixed size.

default size = 16.

You can also set the size in the constructor. The size of the collection after initialization can not change.

After the number of elements has reached the maximum - when you add a new element, the collection "moves" to the left, first element is deleted.
